# Pyraminx-Solver

Reason : I learnt different cubes 3 * 3, 4 * 4, 5 * 5, mirror cube, pyraminx cube etc. once I searched about 3 * 3 solver and there was coding in c++ which can solve 3*3 cube ,in order to get the output of that program we have to entle color of the cube with respect to positions and then program output will tell us steps required to solve it . So I came up with the same idea respect to pyraminx cube and succesfully developed an algorithm in c++ which can solve any scrambled pyraminx cube. 

Tools - Codeblocks , turbo C++
