# Pyraminx-Solver

Reason : In this sem I learnt different cubes 3*3 , 4 *4 , 5*5 , mirror cube , pyraminx cube . once I searched about 3*3 solver and there was coding in c++ which can solve 3*3 cube ,in order to get the output of that program we have to entle color of the cube with respect to positions and then program output will tell us steps required to solve it . So I came up with the same idea respect to pyraminx cube and succesfully developed an algorithm in c++ which can solveany scrambled pyraminx cube. 
Tools - Codeblocks , turbo C++
Objective - To make an Pyraminx Solver which can solve any scrambled position of pyraminx 
Process of implementation - 
Step 1 : Solving tips 
Step 2 : Solving a star 
Step 3 : Finishing one side whole blue 
Step 4 : The second layer 
Step 5 : The third layer 
Details : user have to input colors with respected position so computer will shows steps require to solve it.
Tools - Codeblocks , turbo C++
